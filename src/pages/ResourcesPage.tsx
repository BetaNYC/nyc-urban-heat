            <p className="font-light text-small">When it's very hot, air conditioning will help keep you safe. If you don't have air conditioning, find a cool place to visit nearby, like a friend’s place, a mall, museum, coffee shop, library, or an NYC cooling center. When it's not scorching out but it's still hot, you can also cool off at parks, areas with shade, sprinklers, or pools.</p>

              Hot and humid weather is not just uncomfortable, it can cause heat illness and even death. The extra stress on the body from heat can also worsen chronic health conditions such as heart and lung disease. In NYC, most heatstroke deaths happened to people who were in homes without air conditioning. Air conditioning saves lives.

NYC-EJA empowers its member organizations to advocate for improved environmental conditions and against inequitable environmental burdens by the coordination of campaigns designed to inform City and State policies. Through our efforts, member organizations coalesce around specific common issues that threaten the ability for low-income communities of color to thrive. NYC-EJA is led by the community-based organizations that it serves. NYC-EJA was founded with two clear, yet profound charges: to identify the systemic reasons why communities of color were environmentally and economically overburdened, and to develop strategies to dismantle those inequitable systems.
