            <p className="font-light text-small">When it's very hot, air conditioning will help keep you safe. If you don't have air conditioning, find a cool place to visit nearby, like a friend’s place, a mall, museum, coffee shop, library, or an NYC cooling center. When it's not scorching out but it's still hot, you can also cool off at parks, areas with shade, sprinklers, or pools.https://finder.nyc.gov/coolingcenters

            <p className="font-light text-small">Founded in 1991, the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance (NYC-EJA) is a non-profit, 501(c)3 citywide membership network linking grassroots organizations from low-income neighborhoods and communities of color in their struggle for environmental justice. NYC-EJA empowers its member organizations to advocate for improved environmental conditions and against inequitable environmental burdens by the coordination of campaigns designed to inform City and State policies. Through our efforts, member organizations coalesce around specific common issues that threaten the ability for low-income communities of color to thrive. NYC-EJA is led by the community-based organizations that it serves. NYC-EJA was founded with two clear, yet profound charges: to identify the systemic reasons why communities of color were environmentally and economically overburdened, and to develop strategies to dismantle those inequitable systems.
